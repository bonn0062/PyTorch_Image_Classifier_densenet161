# PyTorch_Image_Classifier_densenet161
Developing an AI application 

This project was put together as a part of the Facebook AI PyTorch Scholarship Challenge through Udacity and relies heavily on Udacity files and writing, and incorporates code provided by Udacity as required for successful completion of the project.

Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. This project trains an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. This project uses a dataset of 102 flower categories and is broken down into multiple steps:

Load and preprocess the image dataset
Train the image classifier on your dataset
Use the trained classifier to predict image content

This application can be trained on any set of images.

Original images were obtained from the 102 Category Flower Dataset, and they are described in the following way by the authors Maria-Elena Nilsback and Andrew Zisserman:

"The images have large scale, pose and light variations. In addition, there are categories that have large variations within the category and several very similar categories. The dataset is visualized using isomap with shape and colour features."
